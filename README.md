# Rice Leaf Disease Identification

For over 50% of the world's population, rice serves as a primary source of daily sustenance. However, a significant challenge arises in rice cultivation: Rice Leaf Diseases. These diseases account for the destruction of 10% to 15% of the global rice harvest annually. Therefore, the identification of these diseases is crucial to initiate proactive measures against them. Unfortunately, many farmers lack the expertise to accurately identify these diseases on their own, necessitating external support.

This is where machine learning proves invaluable. In this project, three distinct machine learning approaches were developed to address the challenge of identifying rice leaf diseases. These methods encompass a spectrum of complexity, beginning with a decision tree algorithm, progressing to more intricate ensemble methods like the random forest, and culminating in a cutting-edge convolutional neural network (CNN) leveraging Transfer Learning with ResNet50, developed by Microsoft Research.
